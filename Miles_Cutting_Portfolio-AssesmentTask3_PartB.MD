Identify a Need:

Need:
A story rich and highly interactive game that will help develop people of all ages cordination, problem solving, and cognitive thinking. 

Problem Statement:
People of all ages have room to improve their thinking, reaction times, and fine motor skills, however, most often lack the time. My focus for this game is to give people an option to relax that also develops these key skills.

Skill Development:
To create this project, I will need to develop a range of skills. To develop these skills, I can use the skills I have learnt from part A, such as how to design and add levels into unity, and I can use a range of free tutorials to learn how to add features such as an inventory system, a health system, and a ememy system.
