Identify a Need:

Need:
A story rich and highly interactive game that will help develop people of all ages cordination, problem solving, and cognitive thinking. 

Problem Statement:
People of all ages have room to improve their thinking, reaction times, and fine motor skills, however, most often lack the time. My focus for this game is to give people an option to relax that also develops these key skills.

Skill Development:
To create this project, I will need to develop a range of skills. To develop these skills, I can use the skills I have learnt from part A, such as how to design and add levels into unity, and I can use a range of free tutorials to learn how to add features such as an inventory system, a health system, and a ememy system.

Requirements Outline:

Inputs:
 - Keyboard Inputs - W, A, S, D, Space, Arrow Keys
 - Mouse Inputs - Clicks, Cursor Location

Example:
The users will use a keyboard to control where the player moves throughout the levels, where and how they interact with items in the level. A mouse will be used to interact with features in the game such as with the inventory or trading menus.

Proccessing:
 - Movement Calculations
 - Currency/Item Calculations

Example:
As the player progresses through the level, it will calculate where the player is, what the player is colliding and interactung with, and when and how they are using items. An example of this is calaulating the process of buying and selling items within the game.

Outputs:
 - Screen Updates
    - Player Movement - The Player moving from one part of a level to another
    - Inventory Updating - Items from inventories being removed and added based on what the player is doing
    - Action/Event Display - Events such enemies and obstacles becomeing seen on the screen and making their actions clear

    - Interactive Noises - When the player collets an item or getting a power up, they will have auditory feedback while it is happening
    - Voice Acting - To keep the story engaging, any part of the story that can't be conveyed with events and movements, voices will be used rather then text

 - Menu's and Screens
    - Start Menu - The player will interact with this screen to choose different save accounts, do level selection, tweak settings, and start the game
    - Game Over - When the player loses, a game over message or screen will show up which will allow the player to choose what they want to do
    - Pause Menu - Because my game will be single player, their will be a pause menu for the player when they need to take a break. It will also allow them to access the settings menu which will allow them to tweak settings mid game.

Transmission:
 - Multiplayer - My game will support local multiplayer which will mean their will be no need for information to be transmitted between computers.
 - Player Accounts - Player accounts will be saved in a easy to find location (which will be configurable) in the game files. This will mean as people want to switch between devices with their account and progress by using removable drives such as USB drives.

Storage:
 - Game Files (Non-Configurable) - All of the game files will be stored locally and together. Example: Unity Files, Game Art/Assests
 - Game Files (Configurable) - Game files that are configurable such as the account settings, and account progress will be stored by default as a sperate folder within the game files, but will have to option to change the location to allow for quick and easy multi-device playing. The use of all local storage will also improve the overall cyber security of my game.
